        Hi, my name is Rachelle
        \n\nI love fish

        \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river,
        or a lake, and definitely the ocean
        Fun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river

        \n\nI like eating fish too. Raw fish, Grilled fish, Smoked fish,
        Poached fish - not so much.
        And sometimes I even go fishing.
        And even less sometimes I actually catch something
